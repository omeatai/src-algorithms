# Multiples of 3 or 5

DESCRIPTION:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

### PYTHON SOLUTION:

```py
def solution(number):
    if number == (abs(number) * -1):
        return 0
    list_of_numbers = [i for i in range(1,number) if i%3==0 or i%5==0]
    return sum(list_of_numbers)
```

```py

```
